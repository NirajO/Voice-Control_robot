## 🧭 Overview
**Voice-Control Robot** is an intelligent Python-based system that allows a robot to respond to natural **voice commands**.  
It uses **offline speech recognition** to interpret phrases such as “move forward,” “turn left,” or “stop,”  
and performs corresponding actions through programmable control logic.

This project demonstrates how **speech recognition**, **command processing**, and **robot motion control** can be integrated to create a natural human–robot interaction experience.
